The centreâ€™s vision is to establish the Digital Twin City concept as the foundation for digital planning, design, construction, and management of sustainable, intelligent, and livable cities and regions throughout Sweden by 2030.

This will be achieved by serving as a national and collaborative arena with an open Digital Twin platform that enables the exchange and accessibility of relevant spatial, user and qualitative data as well as the development of cutting-edge tools and methods that support informed decision-making based on simulations to forecast the response of design interventions. The centre explores, develops, and disseminates digital strategies, services, and business models that deliver value to Swedish society at large.

All centre activities are motivated by improving the health & wellbeing of citizens and the circularity of materials, buildings, and infrastructure in cities and regions.
