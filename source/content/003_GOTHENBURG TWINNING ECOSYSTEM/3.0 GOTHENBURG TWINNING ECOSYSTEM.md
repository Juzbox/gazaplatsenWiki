A second goal of this project was to better understand through this [[Counter-Twinning]] approach be informed by existing [urban digital twinning developments in Gothenburg](https://goteborg.se/wps/portal/start/goteborg-vaxer/sa-planeras-staden/goteborgs-digitala-tvilling/in-english-about-gothenburgs-digital-twin).

I conducted interviews and online research to better understand who is making digital twins in Gothenburg, why they are doing it, and how they are doing it.

This led me to pay specific attention to the [[3.1 Virtual Gothenburg]], Gothenburg's "main twin" as well as the [[3.2 KultVis]], a twin under development I had the chance to participate in envisioning. And then along the way I found interesting things about the role of [[Visual Arena]] in the development of the [[3.3 Virtual Gothenburg Lab]].

This is not an exhaustive mapping of the project but I felt it was important to make sure the Gazaplatsen [[1.0 COUNTER-TWINNING PROTOTYPES]] I developed were explicitly connected to efforts of twinning in Gothenburg.
