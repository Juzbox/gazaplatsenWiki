In Future Frictions, youÂ  explore a neighborhood, interact with neighbors and, at some point, encounter three different speculative technologies such a surveillance drone, an AI cat and a set of sensing pigeons. You will need to make controversial decisions regarding the use of this technology and the data it collects. These decisions are provocative and ambiguous with the intention of opening up spaces for reflection and debate. After making the decisions, Future Frictions brings different urban futures to the present, showing how technology can have an impact on our cities and the interactions we have in them.
