#### About
The project is about visualizing cultural values in urban transformation and knowledge about sharing of these values by several parties. Today, there are many digital tools for displaying different types of data, but cultural values

are often lacking and need to be given attention in the digital landscape.  
Digitalization of cultural data can provide a visual understanding of the effects of culture and thus create better conditions for collaboration between actors who need to work together to promote good living environments.

Research questions are: How can digital visualization contribute to cultural  
data becoming more accessible, integrated, and visible in urban development processes? and How can qualitative, "invisible" cultural values be interpreted, visualized and pedagogically communicated in digital  
models?

#### Personal Note
My involvement in this project amounted to attending six meetings and one ideation session which I facilitated and co-designed with [[Liane Thuvander]]. Through this experience, I was able to learn a lot more about existing Digital Twinning projects in Gothenburg and apply many of the technical knowledge there about mapping shared about the [[MiljoVis]] project for instance, which I was able to use in my digital twin prototypes, especially [[1.1 INVESTIGATIVE ARCHIVE]].

Through this experience I also was able to observe a much more subtle manifestation of the commodification cultural values of the city and how the pressure of developers is transferred to urban planners and the developers of this specific twin through very indirect mechanisms.

The project used as a test bed and key partner the [[Gothenburg Film Studios]].
