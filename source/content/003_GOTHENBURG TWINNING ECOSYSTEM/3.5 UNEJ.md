The Urbanités Numériques En Jeux (UNEJ) project is an experiment conducted from September 2020 to December 2024 as part of the Contributory Learning Territory program. It is the result of a partnership between the Institute for Research and Innovation (IRI) and the Academic Delegation for Educational Digital Technology (DANE) of the Créteil Academy for its management, as well as the Seine-Saint-Denis departmental council for its management and implementation.
