[[3.2 KultVis]]

Chalmers x Goteborg Stad x Infravis x 

"The cultural identity is everywhere in society, so we have 5 buckets but it is present everywhere" [[Barbara Ergstrom]]

Cultural categories in GBG
- Cultural env.
- Cultural meeting places
- Art
- Creative industries
- Identity

**Context:**
Focus on creative industry, in Lindholmen in collaboration with the film studio

**Key Questions**
- "what is the place of qualitative data in DTs?"
- "Should this be 2D or 3D"
- "What parameters do we have?" - 
	- "how does one set of numbers relate to something else? We use indicators as technical proxies" - Marco Adelfio
- Who needs what level of information? Expert v non-expert

**CulturCity**
- "A twin vs THE twin" - a leaf on a tree, and the tree is in the woods -- Barbara Ergstrom , a mirror of reality vs exact twin, this is with regards to the relationship between this DT and [[3.1 Virtual Gothenburg]]
- For cultural actors is it "harmless" to participate in the project or is there something to gain
- "Accessibility is very interesting to city planning" -- Liane Thuvander
- "We want to show this film studio links to a global community" -- Barbara Ergstrom
	- Reference to John Brian Harley's reflections on map making, "this becomes a discussion of power and ethics"
- Should all data be public / open? There is a need for secrecy

**[[MiljoVis]]** 
- Visualization project for urban infrastructure for Traffikverket, generally 2D but shifting into the use on 3D
- Challenges in coordinating between different maps, created in different files types + softwares by different consultants. They have turned to Chalmers to 
- Data:
	- noise (2D visualisations were too confusing)
	- Air pollution
	- social consequences
- Why 3d?
	-verticality helps convey complexity
	- pedestrian POV
	- accessible / democratic / inclusive
	- abstract maps are hard to understand by non-experts
- Visualisation types (vs auralization):
	- Perspectives
		- Plan
		- Bird's eye view
		- Pedestrian
	- UX cues
		- Colors
		- Symbols
		- Scenarios
- They have created a sandbox environment with fictitious data as a prototype, in order to start with the end, postponing the data gathering later
- Color scales are not enough to provide the granularity we need to inform decision making
	- Who needs what level of information
- Users are interested in the limit value (whats the most noise you can make?)
- Residents are interested in knowing which areas are quiet
- "If you're a developer, what's the is not important at all"
- Pipeline: taking 2D maps from reports, and translating into 3D, then we have to readjust the information
- Current color rainbow scale is an issue
	- Color blindness
	- Misuse
	- blue looks like rivers
