Kultvis
Shraddha Kapri
Erik Florberger (City planning)

What is the difference between parameters and other categories to visualize?
What kind of clusters do you wish to create? -- Like an innovation district?
Who will use this?
What are the timescales for each of these?

"Spatial calculators"

MiljoViz on contested spaces!

LEVELS of Parametric representation
- LEVEL A / CONTEXT
	- Integration into the context (cultural values, focus on one but acknowledge the other 4)
- LEVEL B / KEY SYSTEMS
	- Key systems (how to understand the cultural value, w/ cocreation, dialogues, spatial syntax)
- LEVEL C / CONNECTIONS
	- Connections local / national / international, how are these visualized?
- LEVEL D / SPACE PROGRAMMING
	- Simulation of public events
	- Tactical visions / clustering?
