#### V2 / KEY MOMENTS & AUDIO

The second prototype was created to understand the different moving parts: 3D scans + photo collage, sketched annotations, audio bites. This brought me to loosen the original structure based on areas in the map I wanted to call attention too. It also required a lot of planning and coordination with Kamal from [**Gatans Parlament**](https://www.youtube.com/@GatansParlament/videos) and Leo who are both working on documentaries of the camp at different times.

This phase also included several iterations of the visual tone to arrive at a surrealist, larger than life recounting of the space, without being overbearing or too distracting.

#### V1 / TESTING THE BASICS
The first prototype was meant to figure out how to stage an interpretation of the Gazaplatsen site with photos, stories, and 3D scans from across the 192 days of existence, that could capture the variety moments, inhabitants, as well as document its occupation of the space as a means of putting pressure on the university.
