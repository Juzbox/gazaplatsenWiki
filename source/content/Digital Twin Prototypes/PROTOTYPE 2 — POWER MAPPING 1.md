#### V2 / KEY MOMENTS & AUDIO

The second prototype was created to understand the different moving parts: 3D scans + photo collage, sketched annotations, audio bites. This brought me to loosen the original structure based on areas in the map I wanted to call attention too. It also required a lot of planning and coordination with Kamal from [**Gatans Parlament**](https://www.youtube.com/@GatansParlament/videos) and Leo who are both working on documentaries of the camp at different times.

This phase also included several iterations of the visual tone to arrive at a surrealist, larger than life recounting of the space, without being overbearing or too distracting.
