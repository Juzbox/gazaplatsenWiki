### üóÇÔ∏è ABOUT THE PROJECT
Mapping Gazaplatsen is an attempt at exploring how [[Counter-cartography]] can inform the way urban digital twins can be used to challenge normative, market-driven, and often anti-democratic approaches to urban digital twinning. 

The project does so by exploring different ways of mapping a specific site, [[Gazaplatsen]], over the course of the 192 days of its existence thanks to the joined efforts of [**Gothenburg University Students for Palestine**](https://www.instagram.com/gustudentsforpalestine/), [**Social Justice Chalmers**](https://www.instagram.com/chalmers.social.justice/), and support from various local organizations.

This wiki, serves as a sketchbook and a repository for my. In it you will find a non-exhaustive [[GAZAPLATSEN DATABASE]] of videos, images, events, 3D scans from Gazaplatsen, which were used in various ways in the three [[1.0 COUNTER-TWINNING PROTOTYPES]]. You will also be able to see how these prototypes connect to key parts of the [[3.0 GOTHENBURG TWINNING ECOSYSTEM]].

The project was developed by me, [Hugo Pilate](https://hugopilate.com/), in the context of my [Design Masters thesis](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/mfa-programme-in-design-k2den) at HDK-Valand in Gothenburg University.

### ‚õ∫ ABOUT GAZAPLATSEN
Gazaplatsen was formed on May 14th 2024 and taken down on November 22nd 2024. The name is a contraction of Gaza and [**Vasaplatsen**](https://www.google.com/maps/@57.6990647,11.970826,3a,60y,91.45h,92.83t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s_WcGKlYH1stOfN5xiSXlMQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-2.825594300320688%26panoid%3D_WcGKlYH1stOfN5xiSXlMQ%26yaw%3D91.45491749917407!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), in reference to the plaza in front of Gothenburg University's main building.

Over its 192 days of activity, the encampment brought together students of Gothenburg University and Gothenburg residents in protest of the university's reluctance to reckon with [**its own complicity**](https://wassap.se/projects/) in the occupation of Palestine.
