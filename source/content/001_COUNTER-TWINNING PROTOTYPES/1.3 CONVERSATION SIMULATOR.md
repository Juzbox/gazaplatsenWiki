> [!NOTE] OVERVIEW
> CONVERSATION SIMULATOR / A real-time conversation simulation environment in which different actors like student protestors or representatives of the leadership can be made to interact and in doing so surface a variety of perspectives regarding the camp‚Äôs presence in Gothenburg, and the cause it stood for. The technological backend of the prototype was fully coded by the game developer and friend [Mourdjen Bari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mourdjen-bari-2ab20285/?originalSubdomain=fr).

**OBJECTIVE:
SIMULATE ALTERNATIVE OUTCOMES OF THE ENCAMPMENT THROUGH FICTIONAL GENERATIVE EXCHANGES BETWEEN KEY ACTOR ARCHETYPES.**

Made with: [GODOT](https://godotengine.org/) + [CHATGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) in collaboration with [Mourdjen Bari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mourdjen-bari-2ab20285).

#### V3 / CONSOLIDATING THE EXPERIENCE

The ‚Äúgame‚Äù should really make it possible to obtain surprising results so Mourdjen and I are trying to find ways to make players understand how they are navigating the range of ideologies and the argumentation that support them.

#### V2 / MINIMUM VIABLE INTERACTION

The second prototype demonstrated the value and purpose of such a device. We started by focusing on 3 of the 7 actors and one site, the security tent. While the responses quickly got a bit repetitive, it was very interesting to see the three characters listen to each other while always trying to bring the conversation back to their point. Their was a bit of an uncanny valley effect to the whole experience.

#### V1 / MAPPING IDEOLOGIES

The first prototype was created to test the basic structure of the simulation experience. It is inspired by [**this political compass**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/15d8uas/disco_elysium_political_compass/) of Disco Elysium‚Äôs exploration of NPCs‚Äô ideologies.

This prototype was created using discussions and moments I observed while being involved with the camp to map out the stances and possible motivations of of each actors for supporting or fighting the camp.

The hope here being to encourage a reflection on the value of deliberation in public spaces and the role the encampment played in creating such an environment.
