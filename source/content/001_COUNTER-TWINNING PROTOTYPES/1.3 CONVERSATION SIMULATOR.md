> [!NOTE] OVERVIEW
> CONVERSATION SIMULATOR / A real-time conversation simulation environment in which different actors like student protestors or representatives of the leadership can be made to interact and in doing so surface a variety of perspectives regarding the camp‚Äôs presence in Gothenburg, and the cause it stood for. The technological backend of the prototype was fully coded by the game developer and friend [Mourdjen Bari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mourdjen-bari-2ab20285/?originalSubdomain=fr).

| **V4**  | **UPDATING THE VISUALS AND NARROWING THE SCOPE**<br><br>The conversation simulator was at first supposed to have 7 characters and close to 5 locations around [[Gazaplatsen]].<br><br>Due to technical challenges, we've had to limit the initial development to 3 characters (a student activist, the Vice-Chancellor, and a local resident against the camp) and 1 location, (the information tent).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ![[T3_UiMockups-04.png]]                                                                                                        |
| **V3**  | **CONSOLIDATING THE EXPERIENCE**<br><br>Because the experience should really make it possible to obtain surprising results,  Mourdjen and I are trying to find ways to make players understand how they are navigating the range of ideologies and the argumentation that support them.<br><br>This is likely to happen by bringing back the idea of the political compass inspired by the one from [Disco Elysium](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/15d8uas/disco_elysium_political_compass/?rdt=40323).                                                                                                                                                                                             | ![[Screenshot 2025-03-19 204913.png]]                                                                                           |
| **V2**  | **MINIMUM VIABLE INTERACTION**<br><br>Mourdjen managed to get a proof of concept together where [[ChatGPT]] is given three characters to roleplay as based on the indications I provided in the previous phase.<br><br>On my end, I started prototyping what the final UX might feel like. I used isometric assets found on Pinterest that I then collaged in Miro.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ![[2024-11-29 14_37_42-(2).png]]<br><br>![[Screenshot 2025-03-24 234606.png]]<br>![[Screenshot 2025-03-24 234511.png]]          |
| **V1**  | **MAPPING IDEOLOGIES**<br><br>The first prototype was created to test the basic structure of the simulation experience. It is inspired by [**this political compass**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/15d8uas/disco_elysium_political_compass/) of Disco Elysium‚Äôs exploration of NPCs‚Äô ideologies.<br><br>This prototype was created using discussions and moments I observed while being involved with the camp to map out the stances and possible motivations of of each actors for supporting or fighting the camp.<br><br>The hope here being to encourage a reflection on the value of deliberation in public spaces and the role the encampment played in creating such an environment.<br> | ![[Screenshot 2024-12-17 194422.png]]<br><br>![[Screenshot 2024-12-17 194349.png]]<br><br>![[Screenshot 2024-12-17 194701.png]] |
