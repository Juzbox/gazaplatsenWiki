#### V3 / VIOLENCE AT THE THRESHOLD OF DETECTABILITY

The next and final step will be to gather videos and other visuals of the encampment to identify moments of abuse of power.

#### V2 / SPATIAL ANALYSIS

The prototype has evolved to document the encampment through four key chapters of its 192 days life. NEGOTIATIONS / FLUCTUATIONS / OCCUPATION / EVICTION / DISSEMINATION.

The spatial anaylsis served to document key forces and infrastructures that distinguished the camp from phase to phase, while also finding opportunities to document potential abuses of power from the university leadership.

Color coding of functions was applied to the 3D assets in order to see the camp’s evolution over time.

Each of the four maps were first created in 2D through image collation.

This prototype seeks to depict the evolution of the camp and the power negotiations it made possible over time. This has required a significant amount of time to be dedicated to the recreation of the timeline of the camp, building on the [**GUSP Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/gustudentsforpalestine/) and [**Gatan Parlamant’s**](https://www.youtube.com/@GatansParlament) coverage of the movement, and discussions with GUSP members.
