| **V3**  | **VIOLENCE AT THE THRESHOLD OF DETECTABILITY**<br><br>It's strange but it has taken me a long time to figure out WHAT to investigate. <br><br>In the end, I've opted for documenting "spatial domination logics" wherever I could see them.<br><br>The final prototype can be seen either from top view or through a set of cameras angled to point at crowd sourced footage.<br><br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ![[Screenshot 2025-03-24 231435.png]]<br>![[SketchesUI001(1).jpg]]                                                                                                      |
| **V2**  | **SPATIAL ANALYSIS**<br><br>In the end I decided to document the evolution of the camp based on 5 key phases of its 192 days life. NEGOTIATIONS / FLUCTUATIONS / OCCUPATION / EVICTION.<br><br>I arrived at them with conversations with a friend from the encampment and by looking at the [[GAZAPLATSEN DATABASE]] timeline to identify key moments.<br><br>The spatial analysis served to document key forces and infrastructures that distinguished the camp from phase to phase, while also looking for indications of abuses of power from the university leadership.<br><br>I then color coded buildings according to key functions so they could easily be spotted over time.<br><br>Each of the four maps were first created in 2D through image collation. | ![[Screenshot 2025-03-24 231340 1.png]]<br>![[GP_Maps_Days-01.png]]<br><br>![[GP_Maps_Days-02.png]]<br><br><br>![[GP_Maps_Days-03.png]]<br><br>![[GP_Maps_Days-04.png]] |
| **V1**  | **RECONSTRUCTING THE TIMELINE**<br><br>I started this prototype by making very basic spatial experiments inspired by [[Forensic Architecture]]'s own evidentiary archives. <br><br>This prototype required a significant amount of time to be dedicated to the recreation of the timeline of the camp, building on the [**GUSP Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/gustudentsforpalestine/) and [**Gatan Parlamantâ€™s**](https://www.youtube.com/@GatansParlament) coverage of the movement, and discussions with GUSP members.<br><br>You can see a video demo here: https://vimeo.com/1029828218                                                                                                                                                                 | ![[image(15).png]]<br>![[TwinProtos(1).jpg]]<br>![[Screenshot 2024-12-17 193426.png]]<br>![[Screenshot 2024-12-17 193407.png]]                                          |
