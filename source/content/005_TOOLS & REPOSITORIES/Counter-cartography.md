Expert from Forensic Architecture: Violence at the Threshold of Detectability by Eyal Weizman 

"Edward Said wrote critically about the imperial use of cartography: “In the
history of colonial invasions maps are always first drawn by the victors,
since maps are instruments of conquest.” In addition he advocated for a
form of “counter-cartography” able to confront the geographical violence
of European imperialism: “Geography can also be the art of resistance if
there is a counter-map.”

He posed counter-cartography as a ==critical practice that confronts the epistemic violence of imperial maps.== The range of such a practice extends from the psychogeographical representation of the daily lives of the oppressed and the charting of its ==multiple modes of knowledge production to the exposure of the spatial logic of domination, the removal of the privilege== of mapping from the state."
